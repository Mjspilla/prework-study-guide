    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
      <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
      <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
      <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
      <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>

      <li> Closing tags begin with a forward slash.</li>
      <li> We insert the content between an opening tag and a closing tag so that the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>
